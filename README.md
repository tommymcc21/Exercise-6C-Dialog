# Exercise-06C-Dialog
This game you try to make it to the top by doing parkour. You use W,A,S,D to control the player and the space bar to jump. 
I added all that I could from the assignment on canvas.
I added some music that I made the other day that I feel like gave the game a good vibe.
I added a weapon on the ground but I could not figure out the npcs.
I also added some walls and boxes around the map.
